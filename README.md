# Module_20_individual_assessment

***Self-Assessment***

My primary role was to use R programming to do statistical analysis on the datasets in search of trends and observations. By performing deep analysis on the dataframes shared amoung the group, I can find any trends presented to help consult other team mates on what to look for, if any. My back up roles were helping picking data sets to work with and helping guide who does what to have clearly defined goals & distribution of workload. The greatest challenge was working in a collaborative environment as throughout the course, we were working individually. However, my fantastic classmates and I were able to achieve a lot with our skills taught from the bootcamp and communicating often.


***Team Assessment*** 

Scott handled Tableau & was the Github owner who handled merging of the separated branches. Jadon handled minor cleaning of the datasets and created the webpage. Albert handled the cleaning of the dataset, AWS & PostGres SQL, and minor machine learning. I handled R stastics, helping with the webpage, & help guide the overall group. 
Communication between us was handled over Slack messaging. Most of the communcations were handled during our breakout rooms with clearly defined expectations of each other prior to the next class. 
The best trick I highly recommend is deciding early who does what so prevent duplication of work or gaps in work load. Definitely helps remove any fustrations of unclear expectations as this isn't uncommon for people to experience working in groups that lack communication. 
This team did an amazing job on what their roles. 


***Summary of Project***

Our project can easily be shown off on Linkedin or Github to current/future employers as the webpage showcases our skillsets. Whether it involves machine learning or creating a webpage, our project shows everyone who sees it what we are capable of as we all have taken the same bootcamp. Our project primarily used the following:

-Python

-Pandas

-HTML

-JavaScript

-CSS

-Tableau

-R

-Machine Learning

-SQL

-AWS

The results of the project showed that even though we couldn't find a strong claim to our hypothesis, we were able to thoroughly dig into the datasets and evenly distribute the workload in an effective manner.
